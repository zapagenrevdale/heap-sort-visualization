# Heap Sort Visualizer  
#### Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis Project  

This application simulates the **Heap Sort algorithm** using the Java programming language. It was created as part of a **college project** to practice and deepen understanding of sorting algorithms and their visualization.  

## Highlights of the Project  

- **First UI/Animation Application**  
  This was my first attempt at building an application with a user interface and animations, making it a significant milestone in my learning journey.  

- **Built Using Java Swing**  
  The user interface and animations were developed using **Java Swing**, a robust framework for building desktop applications in Java.  

- **Interactive Algorithm Simulation**  
  The application visually demonstrates the Heap Sort algorithm in action, showcasing step-by-step operations, such as heap construction and the sorting process.
